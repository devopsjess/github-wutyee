Git Commands

Here are some of the most commonly used Git commands:

    git clone: to create a copy of a repository from a remote server to your local machine. It copies all the files, branches, and commit history from the remote repository to your local machine. Syntax: git clone <repository_URL> Example: git clone https://github.com/example/repository.git

    git init: Initializes a new Git repository.

    git add: Adds a file to the staging area.

    git commit: Commits the file to the repository.

    git status: Shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.

    git pull: Fetches and merges changes on the remote server to your working directory.

    git push: Pushes your changes to the remote repository.

    git branch: Description: Lists all branches in the repository. The current branch is indicated with an asterisk (*).

    git checkout <branch_name>:



git checkout [branch_name]: Switches to the specified branch, updating the working directory to reflect the state of that branch. It's also used to create new branches by specifying the -b flag followed by the new branch name.

git merge [branch_name]: Merges changes from the specified branch into the currently checked out branch. It combines the changes made in the specified branch with the changes in the current branch.

git pull: Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into the current branch. It's equivalent to running git fetch followed by git merge.

git push: Pushes local commits to a remote repository, updating the remote branch with your changes. It's used to share your work with others and synchronize changes between local and remote repositories.

git remote: Lists the remote repositories associated with the current repository. It provides information such as the remote's name and URL.
